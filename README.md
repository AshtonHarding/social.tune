# Social-Tune

I built this quite a few years ago (wow! over half a decade) and it just halted. I lost several generations of the code, sadly.

## What is ST?
It's a social network replacement that was intended to work against Facebook. A lot of people want the
old myspace 1.0 back and that is what I was intending to create. 

## Why didn't ST even go anywhere?
I just didn't know what I was doing, I guess.

## Can I use this code?
No. You can't. Don't use this code, it is actually horrible and really out of date.
